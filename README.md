# AlgLib
### Template based header-only C++ library containing data structures and algorithms.
## How to use?
To use alglib you only need the header files (`.h`) from `Include/` directory. Include use them just like normal header files. The compilation time of your project will increase. If you're worried if you have a valid version without unknown erros you can perform tests from `Tests/` directory. It is a single `.cc` files that will output results of data structures and algorithms tests. The fastest way to do this is using a [premake](https://github.com/premake) script that i wrote and included in this repo (`premake5.lua`). If you're not sure about usage of this script check out Premakes [manual](https://premake.github.io/docs/).
## Manual
Manual is still in development. It will be added soon.
## Known issues
Right now library is still in very early version and no issues are known so far. If you find any problems feel free to use git to report them.
